# Privileges

Before a transaction is executed, the query parser determines the privileges required for the query. Currently, the followjng
kinds of privileges are recognized:

* "create" (CREATE TABLE)
* "delete" (DELETE FROM)
* "drop" (DROP TABLE)
* "insert" (INSERT INTO)
* "update" (UPDATE)
* "template" (see below)

## Enforcement

Privileges are checked against the special `grants` table. The grants table has three columns:
* "user": the SHA-256 hash of the public key of the user that is allowed the privilege
* "kind": the privilege kind (one of the above strings)
* "table": the table to which the privilege applies. NULL if the privilege applies to all tables.

Note: associated privileges are *not* automatically removed when referenced tables are dropped, nor are grants automatically created when a table is created.

The "table" parameter for a grant can be "grants", in which case the user can perform the indicated operation on the grants table (use wisely). Regardless of the grants table, other special tables (such as _info_ and _blocks_ are never writable).

A transaction can execute if the required privileges exist after processing of the block previous to the one it is part of. A transaction hence cannot depend on privileges created in the same block. When a transaction cannot execute due to missing privileges, it is simply ignored.

The SHA-256 hash of the invoker's public key is stored in `user` instead of the real public key. This ensures that the public key only
becomes known when it is used for the first time, mitigating possible future attacks against (weak) public keys. A similar
protection is present in Bitcoin (where transaction outputs are linked to a hash of the receiver's address).

## Templates

From each mutating query a set of required privileges can be derived. These privileges are then matched
against privileges from the `grants` table. If privileges are missing for a particular statement, the system
derives the *template hash* for the statement and looks for a `template` grant. A template grants allows
the execution of a particular query as long as its template matches the template hash, regardless of the
presence of any other required privileges.

The template hash is the SHA256 hash of the UTF-8 encoded, canonically formatted SQL representation
of a statement whose parameters are all 'unbound'. For example, the following query:

````
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (?what:5);
````

Becomes the following query when parameters are unbound:

````
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (?what);
````

The canonical SQL representation of the above query is:

````
INSERT INTO foo ("x") VALUES (?what);
````

The SHA256 hash of the above query is `f2d1d9be4a547f5583cd7b43f322b284655f12b193be713e0940132fc8cbb2d3`.
If the invoker of the statement has a grant in the `grants` table with kind `template` for the indicated hash,
it will be allowed to execute the first unmodified query. Note that it can also execute the same query with any other value for
the 'what' parameter (e.g. '?x:10').

The invoker *must* use the same name for the bound parameter. With a grant for the above template, executing the
following query would not be allowed:

````
INSERT INTO foo (x) VALUES (?somethingelse:5);
````

## Replay protection

A transaction includes a counter. A transaction will only execute if its counter is exactly equal to the counter value of the previous transaction executed by the invoker (in previous blocks or within the current block), or 0 when the invoker has not yet executed a transaction. When multiple transactions from the same invoker are in the same block, they are executed in the order of increasing counter. The relative ordering of the execution of transactions from different invokers is undefined.

## Bootstrapping grants

A transaction requires permissions to be able to make changes to the database. Permission grants are recorded
in the special `grants` table. This table needs to be created first using a transaction and populated with grants,
which creates an interesting catch-22: how can the grants table be created when there are no grants that would
allow a create transaction? For this reason, grants are only enforced after a block has been appended that
contained at least one transaction inserting into the `grants` table. Users are encouraged to  pre-mine up to
the point where they have set up initial grants.
