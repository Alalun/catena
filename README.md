# Catena - SQL on a blockchain

Catena is a distributed database based on a blockchain, accessible using SQL. 

A Catena blockchain contains SQL transactions that, when executed in order, lead to the agreed-upon state of the database.
The transactions are automatically replicated to, validated by, and replayed on participating clients. A Catena database 
can be connected to by client applications using the PostgreSQL wire protocol (pq). 

Only SQL statements that modify data or structure are included in the blockchain. This is very similar to replication logs
used by e.g. MySQL ('binlog').

## Building

### macOS

Catena builds on macOS. You need a recent version of XCode (>=8.3.2) on your system. Use the following commands to clone
the Catena repository and build in debug configuration:

````
git clone https://github.com/pixelspark/catena.git catena
cd catena
swift build
````

It is also possible to generate an XCode project and build Catena from it:

````
swift package generate-xcodeproj
````

### Linux

Building on Linux is currently not possible, due to the fact that there is no cross-platform WebSocket client
implementation (the current implementation uses Starscream). In the future, we might be able to switch to whatever
comes out of the Swift Server APIs workgroup (which intends to provide cross-platform WebSocket client suport.)

To try and compily anyway, first ensure Swift 3.1 is installed. Then ensure clang and required libraries are present:

````
apt install clang build-essential libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/pixelspark/catena.git catena
cd catena
swift build
````

The above was tested on Debian 8 (Jessie) using the Ubuntu 14.04 release of Swift 3.1.

## Running

The following command starts Catena and joins the chain at the demo server:

````
./.build/debug/Catena -j pixelspark.nl:8338
````

To start two peers locally, use the following:

````
./.build/debug/Catena -p 8338 
./.build/debug/Catena -p 8340 -j 127.0.0.1:8338
````

Catena provides an HTTP interface on port 8338 (default), which can be used for introspecting the blockchain. It also
provides a WebSocket service which is used for communication between peers. 

The (private)  SQL interface is available 
on port 8334 (by default). If you set a different HTTP port (using the '-p' command line switch), the SQL interface 
will assume that port+1. You can connect to the SQL interface using the PostgreSQL command line client:

````
psql -h localhost -p 8334
````

To enable block mining, add the '-m' command line switch. 

## FAQ

### Is Catena a drop-in replacement for a regular SQL database?

No. The goal of Catena is to make it as easy as possible for developers and administrators that are used to working with 
SQL to adopt blockchain technology. Catena supports the PostgreSQL (pq) wire protocol to submit queries, which allows
Catena to be used from many different languages (such as PHP, Go, C/C++). However, there are fundamental differences 
between Catena and 'regular' database systems:

* Catena currently does not support many SQL features.
* Catena's consistency model is very different from other databases. In particular, any changes you make are not immediately visible nor confirmed. Transactions may roll back at any time depending on which transactions are included in the 'winning' blockchain.
* Catena will (in the future) check user privileges when changing or adding data, but can never prevent users from seeing all data (all users that are connected to a Catena blockchain can 'see' all transactions). Of course it is possible to set up a private chain.

### Which SQL features are supported by Catena?

Catena supports a limited subset of SQL (Catena implements its own SQL parser to sanitize and canonicalize SQL queries).
Currently, the following types of statements are supported:

* CREATE TABLE foo (bar TEXT, baz INT);
* INSERT INTO table (x, y, z) VALUES ('text', 1337);
* SELECT DISTINCT *, x, y, 'value', 123 FROM table WHERE x=10;
* DELETE FROM foo WHERE x=10;
* DROP TABLE foo;

SQL has the following limitations:

* Column and table names are case-insensitive, and must start with an alphabetic (a-Z) character, and may subsequently contain numbers and underscores. 
* SQL keywords (such as 'SELECT') are case-insensitive. 
* All statements must end with a semicolon.
* Values can be a string (between 'single quotes') or an integer, or NULL
* An expression can be a value, '*' a column name, or a supported operation
* Supported operators are "=", "<>", "<", ">", ">=", "<="
* Currently only the types 'TEXT' and 'INT' are supported.

In the future, the Catena parser will be expanded to support more types of statements. Only deterministic queries will
be supported (e.g. no functions that return current date/time or random values).

### What kind of blockchain is implemented by Catena?

Catena uses a Blockchain based on SHA-256 hashes for proof of work, with configurable difficulty. Blocks contain 
transactions which contain SQL statements. Catena is written from scratch and is therefore completely different from
Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.

### How does a Catena node talk to other nodes?

Catena nodes expose an HTTP/WebSocket interface. A node connects to the WebSocket interface of all other nodes it knows
about (initially specified from the command line) to fetch block information and exchange peers. In order for two nodes
to be able to communicate, at least one must be able to accept incoming connections (i.e. not be behind NAT or firewall).

### What is the consistency model for Catena?

SQL statements are grouped in transactions, which become part of a block. Once a block as been accepted in the blockchain and
is succeeded by a sufficient number of newer blocks, the block has become an immutable part of the blockchain ledger.

As new blocks still run the risk of being 'replaced' by competing blocks that have been mined (which may or may not include
a recent transaction), the most recent transactions run the risk of being rolled back. 

### How are changes to a Catena blockchain authenticated?

Currently, no authentication has been built in. In the future, Catena will provide a grants system (like in regular databases)
using public keypairs. A transaction that modifies a certain table or row needs to be signed with a keypair that has the
required grants. Grants are stored in a special 'grants' table (which, in turn, can be modified by those that have a 
grant to modify that table).

To prevent replaying signed transactions, Catena will record a transaction number for each public key, which is atomically 
incremented for every transaction that is executed. A transaction will not execute (again) if it has a lower transaction
number than the latest number recorded in the blockchain.

### Where does the name come from?

Catena is Italian for 'chain'.

### Can I run a private Catena chain?
Chains are identified by their genesis (first) block's hash. To create a private chain, use the '-s'  option to specify 
a different starting seed.
